The rapid increase in revenue, particularly from 2020 onwards, reflects strong growth, possibly driven by increased sales volume or higher market demand.<br>\n",

    "Steady Growth: The gross profit shows a substantial increase from $1.85 billion in 2018 to $32.57 billion in 2021. However, there is a noticeable drop in 2022, where gross profit declined to $17.28 billion. This could indicate increased costs, reduced pricing power, or other market pressures in 2022.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The profit margin has shown a high level of consistency, with only minor fluctuations over the years. The slight dip between 2020 and 2021 could indicate a period of increased costs or competitive pricing pressures, but the strong recovery in 2022 shows effective management. The rise to 70.428% in 2022, despite other financial challenges, highlights the company's resilience in maintaining profitability even in potentially tougher market conditions."

    "#### Analysis:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Brick & Mortar:<br>\n",
    "Trend: Revenue for Brick & Mortar has shown a significant upward trend over the years. Starting from $4.68M in 2018, it has increased rapidly, reaching $283.06M by 2022. This indicates a strong growth trajectory, potentially driven by expanding market presence or increased consumer demand.<br>\n",
    "Trend: Gross profit has also grown substantially, paralleling the revenue growth. The increase in gross profit from $46.83M in 2018 to $506.84M in 2022 indicates that the company has been successful in maintaining or enhancing its profitability as it scales.<br>\n",
    "Trend: Profit margin has seen a dramatic increase, especially in recent years. The margin grew from 24.24% in 2018 to an extraordinary 322.55% in 2022. This large increase suggests significant improvements in cost management or pricing strategies, although such high margins in 2022 may warrant further investigation to ensure accuracy.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. E-Commerce:<br>\n",
    "Trend: Revenue for E-Commerce has shown a steady growth trend. It increased from $1.94M in 2018 to $19.20M in 2022. This consistent growth reflects a robust expansion, although the scale is smaller compared to Brick & Mortar.<br>\n",
    "Trend: Gross profit for E-Commerce has also grown significantly, similar to revenue. The profit increased from $19.41M in 2018 to $191.96M in 2022, indicating that the business has been effectively scaling its operations and managing costs.<br>\n",
    "Trend: The profit margin for E-Commerce has improved notably, from 22.99% in 2018 to 295.54% in 2022. This steep rise in margin suggests improved profitability but should be reviewed for accuracy or context, as such high margins may be atypical."

High CLTV customers suggest a strong long-term relationship with significant revenue potential. The substantial revenue and profit generated from these customers highlight India as a vital market with promising growth and sustainability prospects.<br>\n",

    "For both Total Revenue and Total Sales Volume, the mean values are noticeably higher than the median values. This suggests that the distributions of these metrics are skewed, likely to the right. In other words, there are likely some outliers (extremely high values) that are pulling the mean upward, making it greater than the median.<br>\n",

    "The fact that the mean is significantly higher than the median suggests that the distribution of total sold quantities is likely right-skewed. In other words, there are some high values (outliers) that are pulling the mean upwards.<br>\n",
    "The standard deviation measures the dispersion or spread of the data around the mean. A high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.\n",
    "Given that the standard deviation is quite large relative to the mean and median, it implies substantial variability in the total sold quantities. This high variability suggests that while some quantities are relatively low, others are much higher, contributing to a wide range of values.<br>\n",
    "The distribution of total sold quantities is likely skewed to the right, given that the mean exceeds the median by a considerable margin. This could be due to a few transactions with exceptionally high quantities."

    "\n",
    "2020<br>\n",
    "Pandemic Impact: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a global economic shock. Initially, inflation was subdued as demand plummeted during lockdowns.<br>\n",
    "Supply Chain Disruptions: As economies started to reopen, supply chains were severely disrupted, particularly in industries like semiconductors, logistics, and manufacturing, causing cost pressures to rise toward the end of 2020.<br>\n",
    "2021<br>\n",
    "Rising Demand & Supply Constraints: Global economies rebounded strongly, but supply chains couldn't keep up, leading to shortages in goods. This mismatch between demand and supply began to push inflation higher globally.<br>\n",
    "Energy Prices: A surge in energy prices, particularly oil and natural gas, contributed to higher transportation and production costs, further fueling inflation.<br>\n",
    "Monetary Policy Lags: Central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, initially viewed inflation as \"transitory\" and did not raise interest rates, which allowed inflation to rise further throughout the year.\n",
    "2022<br>\n",
    "War in Ukraine: The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 exacerbated the inflationary pressures, particularly in energy and food markets. Europe was hit especially hard by rising natural gas prices.\n",
    "Global Tightening: Central banks responded by aggressively raising interest rates to control inflation. The U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks across Europe, Latin America, and Asia rapidly increased rates, leading to slower economic growth but helping to curb inflation by the end of the year.\n"

The dollar weakened during the height of the pandemic but surged in 2022 as the U.S. Fed raised interest rates to combat inflation, leading to broad-based currency depreciation in many parts of the world."
